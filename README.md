## Development Process

This project was developed following these steps:

1. Set up the basic HTML structure for the extension manager
2. Implemented the CSS styling with a mobile-first approach
3. Added responsive design for desktop views
4. Developed the search and filtering functionality with JavaScript
5. Implemented extension toggle switches and interactions
6. Added animations and transitions for interactive elements
7. Tested across different browsers and screen sizes
8. Optimized for performance and accessibility

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Extension List Performance
- **Problem**: Ensuring smooth performance when displaying and filtering potentially large lists of extensions
- **Solution**: Implemented efficient DOM manipulation and search algorithms to maintain responsiveness

### Challenge 2: Toggle Switch Design
- **Problem**: Creating visually appealing and accessible toggle switches
- **Solution**: Used custom CSS with proper ARIA attributes to ensure the toggles were both attractive and accessible

### Challenge 3: Responsive Layout
- **Problem**: Designing an interface that works well on both small mobile screens and large desktop displays
- **Solution**: Employed CSS Grid and Flexbox with carefully designed breakpoints to adapt the layout appropriately

## Future Improvements

- Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering extensions
